# Roblox-Transitions
A couple of UI transitions made in Roblox Lua.

These transitions work like powerpoint transitions, and can be used to smoothen positional camera shifts; for example, in cutscenes. If a transition is labeled "in", then if is shifting into a black screen, and if it is labeled "out", then it is shifting out of a black screen. These should obviously be paired with each other. Other than that, feel free to do with them as you please. Also, these only work in local and module scripts. N.B. If you want them to work upon starting the game, put them in a "LocalScript" inside "StarterCharacterScripts".

Feel free to add your own transitions by creating a pull request!
